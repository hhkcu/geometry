## 5 kajillion minecraft skins lol

uhhh i had to split geometry.json into a few files cuz roblox probably wont download a 50mb json file and parse it quickly \
index.json gives u the file number for a skin name \
doc.json is just a random skin i use as documentation to write a skin importer hahaha

not my pack i js wanted it hosted somewhere \
gg!

oh btw to get a geometry file:
* get the file number from `geometry_index[skinName]`
* get `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hhkcu/geometry/main/splits/geometry_[filenumberhere].json`
* ez!
